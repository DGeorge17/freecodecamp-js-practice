 ### Build a Teacher Chatbot (Workshop)
 In this workshop project, I built a Teacher Chatbot using JavaScript to simulate structured responses based on user input. The project focuses on applying conditional logic, functions, and string manipulation to create clear and consistent interactions.
This workshop strengthened my understanding of control flow and basic chatbot design, while emphasizing clean, readable, and well-structured JavaScript code.
